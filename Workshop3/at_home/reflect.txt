1. Deallocated dynamic memory can cause memory leaks when 
   a pointer to a dynamic memory goes out of scope. 
2. The two methods of formatting IO stream data are: 
   1. by using <iostream> header file where manipulators don't take any arguments. ex. left
   2. by using <iomanip> header file where manipulators take arguments. ex. setw(5)
3. Dynamic memory is required in the main() function as we are not aware 
   the exact number of days that every user of the program will input. 
   Hence, we can only allocate memory that is needed at run-time when 
   user will define how many days he/she required.
