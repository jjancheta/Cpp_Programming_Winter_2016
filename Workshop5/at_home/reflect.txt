1. allocateAndCopy() function is being called from the read() function when user entered 
   a correct format of input(e.g. Type, 999 9999).  Inside this function, it will validate first if the
   the arguments passed by read() function are valid by calling the isValid() function (if the type is 
   not null and the area and number are within limits).  If its a valid area, number and type or isValid() function
   return a true value, it will copy the values of the arguments to the object's data members and allocateAndCopy()
   function will return a true value to read() function.  

   If isValid return a false value to allocateAndCopy(), it will not copy the values to the object's data members 
   allocaAndCopy() pass the same a false value to read() and read() function will display several error messages 
   and ask the user to input another phone number type.


2. copy constructor and assignment operator prevent the system in creating a nameless object of a class. 
   It safely copy values passed  to them by verifying first if its empty or the arguments is pointing to the same
   address as the object before writing to the object's data members.
