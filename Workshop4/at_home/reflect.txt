1. Safe empty state is when data members of the class' objects were initialized to null, zeroes and false respectively.
	a.) name_[0] = 0;
		
            code_[0] = 0;
		
	    year_ = 0;
		
	    semester_ = 0;
		
	    slot_ = 0;
		
	    enrolled_ = false;

	b.) This state was selected because these are only values that can defined variables as null.

2. Multiple constructors in the program can able to validates and set or passed the values to the 
   data members of class' objects.  While calling the constructors at code of the client, you dont need
   to call the set() function again as constructors are already link to set() function inside the
   inside the implementation file.
