1.  Virtual functions are member functions of a class and can be identified with the keyword "virtual".  
    These virtual functions are overshadowed if implemented with same function names inside a derived/child class. 

2.  Virtual functions have methods implemented in a class while pure virtual functions 
    have NO implementation method in a class but it can be inherited and implemented inside a derived/child class.

3.  Abstract class consists of 1 or more pure virtual member functions. This abstract class cannot be
    instantiated but can be inherited. Interface class is when all member functions are pure virtual.  Vehicle.h
    is an example of an interface class.
