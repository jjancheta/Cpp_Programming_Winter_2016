1. Friend helper function is basically not a member of the class but they have a direct access
   to the private members of the class which is very dangerous especially for data members as they can able to
   modify or change the values. Its just like you giving a backdoor to access the private members of the class.

2. Yes.

	Account& Account::operator+(const Account& other){
		
             double balance;
		
             balance = balance_ + other.balance_)
		
             return Account(balance);       //creates a nameless object
 using the constructor with 1 argument
	}

3. A nameless object is being created first using the constructor with 1 argument passing the value of 100.01.
   Once created this nameless object, C will call the operator += and do the operation inside the function.
   After which, the nameless object will become out of scope/die.  Then B object will call again the operator+= with
   the new value of C and do the operation inside the function.  The function operator+= will return the new value
   of B and then assign it to A.
